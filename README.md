# Guess My Number Game ðŸ’¥

<br />

## Description ðŸ’¬

This project is a simple number guessing game implemented in JavaScript. The game generates a random integer between 1 and 20, and the player has to guess the number. The player's score decreases with each incorrect guess, and the game provides feedback on whether the guess is too high or too low. If the player guesses correctly, the game displays a winning message, updates the high score if applicable, and changes the background color to indicate success. The player can also reset the game and play again by clicking the "Again!" button, which restores the original settings.
